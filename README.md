# Kata: Link Parser

It is your job, should you choose to accept it, is to refactor the Link parser:

  1. To make it clearer and more understadable
  1. [Optional] to make it functional code

## Introduction

The team has received a mail from the business:

> We are in the business of parsing links.
>
>The main programmers have left (sorry for the low bus factor!) but before leaving, they certified
>the existing code as correct. The users are happy with it. Therefore, the behaviour is correct,
>but just not very developer-friendly.
>
>We are trying this 'functional programming' thing that the programmers talk so much about. You
>can make it functional if you want, but please make it easy to modify first.
>
>Good luck, you are going to need it ('YAGNI')

## Start

The easiest solution is to clone the repo, choose your language, and execute the tests.
They should be green.

Refactor the production code to comply with the above goals.
